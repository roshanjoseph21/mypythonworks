How Does Voting Work For The UEFA Men's Player Of The Year Award?
An initial shortlist of players was drafted by the UEFA technical study group based on their performances for club and country during the 2022/23 season.
Jury members then each got to vote for their top three players by allocating five points, three points and one point respectively.
The jury included the head coach of each club that had competed in the group stage of the 2022/23 UEFA Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League.
National team head coaches from UEFA member nations also got to vote, as did a group of journalists selected by the European Sports Media.
Coaches were not permitted to vote for a player from their own team.
When Will The Winner Be Announced?
De Bruyne, Messi or Haaland will be presented with the UEFA Men's Player of the Year award on August 31.
The award winner will be announced during the Champions League group stage draw ceremony in Monaco.
